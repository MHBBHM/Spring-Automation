# Spring Element Problem Solver

## Purpose

This Python script generates a global stiffness matrix, a force vector, and a displacement vector for any type of spring element problem. It takes user input for the number of nodes, the number of elements, which nodes have forces applied, and more.

## Code Description

The code performs the following steps:

1. **Initialize Variables:** Initialize variables for the number of elements (`e`), the number of nodes (`n`), and arrays for the global stiffness matrix (`K`), the force vector (`f`), and the degrees of freedom (`Edof`).
2. **Get Element Information:** Prompt the user to input information about each element, including the initial and final node numbers.
3. **Assemble Stiffness Matrix:** Assemble the global stiffness matrix based on user input for stiffness values of each element.
4. **Get Node Forces:** Prompt the user to input force values for each node.
5. **Define Supports:** Prompt the user to input the number of supports and specify which nodes are supported.
6. **Solve for Displacement and Reaction Forces:** Solve the system of equations to determine the displacement vector (`U`) and reaction forces vector (`F`).
7. **Print Results:** Display the global stiffness matrix, force vector, displacement vector, and reaction forces.
